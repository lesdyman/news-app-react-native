    content: `Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said the war with Russia could end sooner than some people think. 'I think that we are closer to peace than we think',- he told US broadcaster ABC NEWS. He added that Ukraine could push Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the conflict, but only if Kyiv was coming from a "strong position" - once again calling on his Western allies to strengthen the Ukrainian army. The Ukrainian president is in the US this week to speak at the United Nations General Assembly and to present what he has called a "victory plan" to his Western allies, including US President Joe Biden. In a statement ahead of the visit, Zelensky said the plan included further weapons donations, diplomatic efforts to force Russia to agree to peace, and holding Moscow accountable for its full-scale invasion in 2022. In his interview with ABC News, Zelensky said his victory plan was not about negotiating with Russia, but rather it was "a bridge to a diplomatic way out, to stop the war". On Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was being cautious about media reports of a Ukrainian plan and added that the conflict would only end when Russia's aims were achieved. Zelensky has for some time been asking Western countries to allow Ukraine to ease restrictions on the use of long-range missiles which could be used to strike deep into Russia. He is expected to do so again this week as he visits the US. On Sunday, Biden said he had not yet decided whether to give Ukraine the green light. Zelensky said the US would need to lead the decision: "Everybody's looking up to [Biden], and we need this to defend ourselves," he told ABC. Zelensky will speak at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday and is also due to meet US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. The president of the Czech Republic, Petr Pavel, told the New York Times that Ukraine would have to be "realistic" about its prospects of recovering the areas in the east of the country which Russia has managed to gain over the last 31 months of war. He added that the most likely outcome of the war was that a part of Ukrainian territory would remain under Russian occupation for a number of years. A defeat of either Ukraine or Russia "will simply not happen", Pavel told the Times, adding that the end of the conflict would be "somewhere in between". Zelensky's US trip comes as Ukraine continues to come under sustained attack by Russia. An incursion by Ukrainian troops into Russia's Kursk region in August failed to ease the pressure put by Moscow on eastern Ukraine. Several regions continue to see daily casualties and widespread damage to Ukraine's energy infrastructure. There are concerns Russia could seize more key towns in the east of the country. In a daytime attack on Tuesday, Russia hit a high-rise apartment block in Ukraine's northeastern city of Kharkiv. At least three people died and 15 were injured in the attack, which local authorities said was carried out with glide bombs. On Monday night, an attack on the eastern Ukrainian town of Poltava damaged infrastructure, while in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia one person died and six others were wounded following "massive air strikes". Russian troops have made serious advances in the east and are closing in on Vuhledar - a city on the southern part of the Donbas front line that the Russians have been trying to seize since the beginning of their full-scale invasion. Ukrainian military expert and retired colonel Kostyantyn Mashovets warned his fellow Ukrainians they had to be "psychologically prepared" for the loss of Selydove, Toretsk and Vuhledar in the eastern region of Donbas. "I would love to be wrong," he wrote on Facebook. "But from the information I have... this is a very likely scenario of events in the near future."`,

    content: `Police in Switzerland made multiple arrests after a woman reportedly ended her life using a so-called suicide pod, in apparently the first case of its kind. Police in the Schaffhausen region said they arrested "several persons" on suspicion of inciting, and aiding and abetting suicide after she died reportedly by using a pod made by the company Sarco on Monday. While assisted dying is legally protected in some circumstances in Switzerland, it is strictly regulated and the Sarco pod has encountered opposition. Officers recovered the device and body at the scene. Warning: Contains distressing content. The company behind the controversial pod says it can be solely operated by the person seeking to end their own life, without medical supervision. Police said it was used on Monday at a forest hut in the Merishausen area, a sparsely populated part of Switzerland on the German border. Police said they were tipped off by a law firm about a suicide involving the device. The number of people arrested and their identities were not disclosed. The deceased also was not named. In July, a pro-assisted dying group, which promotes the Sarco device, said it anticipated that it would be used for the first time this year. Advocates say it provides an option not reliant on drugs or doctors, and that it expands access to euthanasia as the portable device can be 3D-printed and assembled at home. However, there also has been opposition in Switzerland, despite the country having some of the world's most protective laws surrounding assisted dying. Critics fear the device's modern design glamorises suicide and the fact that it can be operated without medical oversight is concerning. Assisted dying is illegal in the UK and in most other European countries, but thousands have travelled to Switzerland over the years to end their own lives.`,

    content: `Cats have more freedom than women in Afghanistan, Hollywood actress Meryl Streep has said in an appeal to the international community to stop the Taliban's repression. Speaking on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, the actress pointed out that even animals had more rights now in Afghanistan following increased restrictions on women. In response, a Taliban spokesman said they "highly respected" women and would "never compare them to cats". Streep's comments come after the Taliban government last month introduced a new set of "morality laws". Among other things, these rules state that women's voices can no longer be heard in public and that they are not allowed to look directly at men they are not related to by blood or marriage. The measures add to a litany of restrictions that the regime has imposed on Afghan women and girls since returning to power three years ago. Women have to completely cover their faces and bodies when leaving their homes. Women and girls are also prevented from going to schools, parks, gyms and sport clubs. There are restrictions on the type of work that they are allowed to do. "Today in Kabul a female cat has more freedom than a woman. A cat may go sit on her front stoop and feel the sun on her face, she may chase a squirrel in the park," Streep said on Monday at an event to raise awareness of Afghan women's rights at the UN headquarters in New York. "A squirrel has more rights than a girl in Afghanistan today because the public parks have been closed to women and girls by the Taliban. "A bird may sing in Kabul, but a girl may not in public. This is extraordinary. This is a suppression of the natural law. "The way that this culture, this society has been upended, is a cautionary tale for the rest of the world," said Streep, who called on world leaders to "stop the slow suffocation" of Afghan women and girls. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who attended the same event, said Afghanistan "will never take its rightful place on the global stage" without educated women and women in employment. In response to Streep's remarks, a Taliban spokesman said that "none can deny women the rights which Islam has given them". "We highly respect them in their role as mother, sister, wife. They are [an] essential part of [the] family and society but we never compare them to cats," Suhail Shaheen, the head of the Taliban's political office, told the BBC. He added that currently hundreds of thousands of women work in various government ministries and as entrepreneurs. Western countries, led by the United States and the European Union, have faced criticism for engaging with the Taliban while they have continued to impose gender-based restrictions.`,
